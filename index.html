        <h1 id="evolution">HTML  EVOLUTION</h1>
        <p>In 1995, the IETF organization organized an HTML working group and on September 22 they published the HTML 2.0 standard. Despite its name, HTML 2.0 is the first official HTML standard, Starting in 1996, HTML standards are published by another standards body, the W3C. HTML 3.2 was released on January 14, 1997 and is the first HTML recommendation published by the W3C.
         HTML standardization activity stopped, and the W3C focused on developing the XHTML standard. For this reason, in 2004, the companies Apple, Mozilla and Opera expressed their concern about the lack of interest of the W3C in HTML and decided to organize themselves in a new association called WHATWG
         HTML5 is already a standard (recommended), the W3C consortium, with the inventor, presented the final version on October 27, 2014.
         HTML 4.0 was released on April 24, 1998 (corrected version of the December 18, 1997 release) and was a huge leap from previous versions.

        <p>In 1995, the IETF organization organizes an HTML working group and manages to publish, on September 22 of that same year, the HTML 2.0 standard. Despite its name, HTML 2.0 is the first official HTML standard.
            Starting in 1996, HTML standards are published by another standardization body called W3C (World Wide Web Consortium).
            HTML 3.2 was released on January 14, 1997 and is the first HTML recommendation published by the W3C.
            HTML 4.0 was released on April 24, 1998 (being a corrected version of the original December 18, 1997 release) and is a big leap from previous versions. Among its most notable innovations are CSS style sheets, the possibility of including small programs or scripts in web pages, improved accessibility of designed pages,
             complex tables and improvements in forms.
            The last official appearance of HTML was published on December 24, 1999 and is called HTML 4.01. It is a review and update of the HTML 4.0 version, so it does not include significant new features.
            Since the release of HTML 4.01, HTML standardization activity has stopped and the W3C has focused on the development of the XHTML standard.
            For this reason, in 2004, the companies Apple, Mozilla and Opera expressed their concern about the lack of interest of the W3C in HTML and decided to organize themselves into a new association called WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group).
            The current activity of the WHATWG is focused on the future HTML5 standard, the first official draft of which was published on January 22, 2008.
            Due to the strength of the companies that make up the WHATWG group and the publication of the HTML 5.0 drafts, in March 2007, the W3C resumed the HTML standardization activity.
            Parallel to its activity with HTML, W3C has continued to standardize XHTML, an advanced, XML-based version of HTML.
            The first version of XHTML is called XHTML 1.0 and was published on January 26, 2000 (and later revised on August 1, 2002) XHTML 1.0 is an adaptation of HTML 4.01 to the XML language, so it keeps almost all of its tags and features, but adds some XML-specific restrictions and elements.
            The XHTML 1.1 version has already been released in draft form and is intended to modularize XHTML.
            The draft of XHTML 2.0 has also been published, which will be a very important change with respect to previous versions of XHTML.</p> 
            
            <h1 id="versions">HTML versions</h1>
            <p>The official HTML standards are HTML 2.0, HTML 3.2, HTML 4.0, HTML 4.01, and HTML 5. HTML 5 is the latest official release and is expected to continue to evolve over the next few years.</p>
